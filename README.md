# claude-desktop-buddy

Claude for macOS and Windows can connect Claude Cowork and Claude Code to
maker devices over BLE, so developers and makers can build hardware that
displays permission prompts, recent messages, and other interactions. We've
been impressed by the creativity of the maker community around Claude -
providing a lightweight, opt-in API is our way of making it easier to build
fun little hardware devices that integrate with Claude.

> **[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)** for the wire protocol: Nordic UART
> Service UUIDs, JSON schemas, and the folder push transport.

As an example, we built a desk pet on the M5 Dial that lives off permission
approvals and interaction with Claude. It sleeps when nothing's happening,
wakes when sessions start, gets visibly impatient when an approval prompt is
waiting, and lets you approve or deny right from the device.

## Hardware

The firmware targets the **[M5 Dial](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/M5Dial)**
(ESP32-S3, 1.28" round 240×240 GC9A01 display, rotary encoder with click
button, BM8563 RTC, piezo buzzer). It depends on the `m5stack/M5Dial`
PlatformIO library (which pulls in M5Unified + M5GFX). To target a
different board you'd need to swap that dependency and adjust the
geometry constants in `src/main.cpp` and `src/buddy.cpp`.

## Flashing

Install
[PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/),
then:

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

If you're starting from a previously-flashed device, wipe it first:

```bash
pio run -t erase && pio run -t upload
```

Once running, you can also wipe everything from the device itself: **hold A
→ settings → reset → factory reset → tap twice**.

## Pairing

To pair your device with Claude, first enable developer mode (**Help →
Troubleshooting → Enable Developer Mode**). Then, open the Hardware Buddy
window in **Developer → Open Hardware Buddy…**, click **Connect**, and pick
your device from the list. macOS will prompt for Bluetooth permission on
first connect; grant it.

</p>

Once paired, the bridge auto-reconnects whenever both sides are awake.

If discovery isn't finding the stick:

- Make sure it's awake (any button press)
- Check the stick's settings menu → bluetooth is on

## Controls

The M5 Dial is driven by a single rotary encoder with a click button:

|                | Normal              | Pet / Info  | Menu / Settings | Approval                  |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Rotate**     | scroll transcript   | next page   | move selection  | toggle **OK** ↔ **NO**    |
| **Press**      | next screen         | next screen | confirm         | **send chosen decision**  |
| **Hold press** | menu                | menu        | close panel     | menu                      |

The screen auto-powers-off after 30s of no interaction (kept on while an
approval prompt is up, or while plugged into USB). Any rotation or press
wakes it.

## ASCII pets

Eighteen pets, each with seven animations (sleep, idle, busy, attention,
celebrate, dizzy, heart). Menu → "next pet" cycles them with a counter.
Choice persists to NVS.

## GIF pets

If you want a custom GIF character instead of an ASCII buddy, drag a
character pack folder onto the drop target in the Hardware Buddy window. The
app streams it over BLE and the stick switches to GIF mode live. **Settings
→ delete char** reverts to ASCII mode.

A character pack is a folder with `manifest.json` and 96px-wide GIFs:

```json
{
  "name": "bufo",
  "colors": {
    "body": "#6B8E23",
    "bg": "#000000",
    "text": "#FFFFFF",
    "textDim": "#808080",
    "ink": "#000000"
  },
  "states": {
    "sleep": "sleep.gif",
    "idle": ["idle_0.gif", "idle_1.gif", "idle_2.gif"],
    "busy": "busy.gif",
    "attention": "attention.gif",
    "celebrate": "celebrate.gif",
    "dizzy": "dizzy.gif",
    "heart": "heart.gif"
  }
}
```

State values can be a single filename or an array. Arrays rotate: each
loop-end advances to the next GIF, useful for an idle activity carousel so
the home screen doesn't loop one clip forever.

GIFs render centered on the 240×240 round face. Keep them under ~180×180
so corners stay clear of the round bezel, and crop tight to the character
— transparent margins waste screen and shrink the sprite.
`tools/prep_character.py` handles the resize: feed it source GIFs at any
sizes and it produces a normalized set where the character is the same
scale in every state.

The whole folder must fit under 1.8MB —
`gifsicle --lossy=80 -O3 --colors 64` typically cuts 40–60%.

See `characters/bufo/` for a working example.

If you're iterating on a character and would rather skip the BLE round-trip,
`tools/flash_character.py characters/bufo` stages it into `data/` and runs
`pio run -t uploadfs` directly over USB.

## The seven states

| State       | Trigger                     | Feel                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `sleep`     | bridge not connected        | eyes closed, slow breathing |
| `idle`      | connected, nothing urgent   | blinking, looking around    |
| `busy`      | sessions actively running   | sweating, working           |
| `attention` | approval pending            | alert, prompt overlay shown |
| `celebrate` | level up (every 50K tokens) | confetti, bouncing          |
| `dizzy`     | (unused on M5 Dial)         | spiral eyes, wobbling       |
| `heart`     | approved in under 5s        | floating hearts             |

## Project layout

```

  xfer.h         — folder push receiver
  stats.h        — NVS-backed stats, settings, owner, species choice

```

## Availability

The BLE API is only available when the desktop apps are in developer mode
(**Help → Troubleshooting → Enable Developer Mode**). It's intended for
makers and developers and isn't an officially supported product feature.
